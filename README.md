This is a version of hangman that can be played in the terminal.
You will be able to guess the wrong letter six times before the
secret word is revealed, unless you win at which point the game will end.

The program will read the "5desk.txt" file and from it will select a random word
between 5 and 12 characters.

You can save your game during your turn by typing "save". When you run the program,
you will receive a prompt to load a save by typing "load", or start a new game by
typing "new". The save file is a txt document that shows the secret word, so no
cheating!

If you do save your game, you will overwrite the last save so keep this in
mind before saving.

If you try to load a save that doesn't exist, a new game will start instead.
